Today, it’s the beginning of the work on our project for the web 3 course. The idea of the project is on my mind since the beginning of the course. It was clear and without any hesitation to make as a project a website for the GK petroleum company. A website where the owner or the manager of the gas station(which is the company we talk about) can finish all the work and all the calculation from A to Z, and on the other hand a website which a customer can visit and do various things such as make a meeting with the manager, contact the administration, make a request for product and other things.<br/><br/>
In order to make the work more easier,  to get rid from all the papers and the notebook, to turn the business into digital world and to keep up with the new world of technology we are going to build this website. A one which is easy to use from the two sides : the manager and the customer.  <br/><br>
Before diving into the project and the details we need to talk about some points : Why are we doing this? What are we  doing and who will benefit form the work or the project that we are we going to make. </br><br>
<strong>Why are we doing this project?</strong></br></br>
One of the materials of the 4th semester (2nd semester in the 2nd year) is all about of a project to do. The material is “Development Web(3) : mise en pratique”. The project will be a website and the purpose from this project is to use all this languages : Html, css, javascript and php. So the goal of the project is to practice what we have learned in web1 and web2. For sure it is an independent material and all the note will be depending on the project. So we are going to build a complete website. We need to work on the front-end and the back-end sides. Front-end is all about the design and all what the user or the customer or the manager will see, and the back-end is all about the inner-code ,the software behind all the operations and all the process which take places on our site.

<strong>What we are doing? </strong><br/><br>
I think it had become clear what we are doing. You can tell it a website, a site or anything else in this meaning. Another time, our work is a project. The project is a website but not a simple one. A full and complete website by the design and the content, to fuel company, a little more bigger than a fuel station. It will be in the hand of the manager and the customer. The manager will have access to some pages which the customer will have not. Here we are talking about pages where the manager has a special work the company like organizing of  the accounts of the customers, making the operations of this accounts, make all the calculations of the sell and the buy (it is much bigger than only buy and sell) and other procedures concerning the administration.
